# Additional Notes
1. KaanBOT is designed and being used in the [Computer Science Türkiye](https://discord.gg/CRy8eER) discord server.

3. Since it is running on Turkish server, messages, notifications and other properties are in Turkish language.
4. You can visit my discord server and let me know if you have a question.
